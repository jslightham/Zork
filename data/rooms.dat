Hey Victoria! Luca here. 
Great job with the room-making. I like your descriptions a lot. Just a few notes with this rooms file:
1. Please, please, PLEASE make absolutely sure that your direction are in UPPER CASE when you are making the exits, otherwise it breaks the game. 
2. Try to keep everything consistent w/ the stuff that is already on this page. 
3. If you want, you can look at images of Casa Loma for inspiration, but I trust you have great descriptive writing skills, judging by the descriptions below. 

That's all from me... Oh, make sure to delete this comment after you're done reading it. It will break the game...
