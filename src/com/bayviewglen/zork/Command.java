/**
 * Class Command - Part of the "Zork" game.
 * 
 * author: Michael Kolling version: 1.0 date: July 1999
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user. A
 * command currently consists of two strings: a command word and a second word
 * (for example, if the command was "take map", then the two strings obviously
 * are "take" and "map").
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid command
 * words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not known) then
 * the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
 *
 * The second word is not checked at the moment. It can be anything. If this
 * game is extended to deal with items, then the second part of the command
 * should probably be changed to be an item rather than a String.
 * test
